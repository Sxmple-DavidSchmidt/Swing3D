# Swing3D

Swing3D is a fun project I made to render 3D Graphics using Swing and its basic drawing methods. This project is primarily meant to be an educational journey to learn about the math involved with rending 3D Graphics on a 2D screen.
If you only care about actual math and how I applied it to get this working have a look at [the RenderingPipeline](src/util/RenderingPipeline.java). Comments are written in german as I was using this project to teach a friend of mine.
